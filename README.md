**Requirement Analysis in Software Development**
**Introduction**
-This repository demonstrates the process of requirement analysis in software development. Requirement analysis is a critical phase that helps identify, document, and validate the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. The purpose of this repository is to illustrate key concepts such as types of requirements, functional vs non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria using a Booking Management System case study.

**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It acts as the foundation for the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it determines what the system should do before design and implementation begin.

**Importance in SDLC**

Clarity and Understanding: Ensures that all stakeholders (clients, developers, and testers) have a shared understanding of the project requirements.

Reduces Errors: Early detection of incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous requirements reduces costly errors later in development.

Guides Development: Provides a clear roadmap for design, coding, and testing phases.

Improves Customer Satisfaction: Meeting the actual needs of users leads to higher satisfaction and successful project delivery.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC because it lays the groundwork for the entire project. Here are three main reasons why it is essential:
**1.Prevents Scope Creep**
Clear requirements help avoid unnecessary changes or additions during development, saving time and costs.

**2.Improves Communication**
It ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should achieve, reducing misinterpretations.

**3.Ensures Quality and Customer Satisfaction**
By understanding user needs early, the development team can deliver software that meets or exceeds expectations.
