**Requirement Analysis in Software Development**
**Introduction**
-This repository demonstrates the process of requirement analysis in software development. Requirement analysis is a critical phase that helps identify, document, and validate the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. The purpose of this repository is to illustrate key concepts such as types of requirements, functional vs non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria using a Booking Management System case study.

**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It acts as the foundation for the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it determines what the system should do before design and implementation begin.

**Importance in SDLC**

Clarity and Understanding: Ensures that all stakeholders (clients, developers, and testers) have a shared understanding of the project requirements.

Reduces Errors: Early detection of incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous requirements reduces costly errors later in development.

Guides Development: Provides a clear roadmap for design, coding, and testing phases.

Improves Customer Satisfaction: Meeting the actual needs of users leads to higher satisfaction and successful project delivery.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC because it lays the groundwork for the entire project. Here are three main reasons why it is essential:
**1.Prevents Scope Creep**
Clear requirements help avoid unnecessary changes or additions during development, saving time and costs.

**Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**
Requirement Analysis involves several important activities that help ensure the software product meets user needs. These are:

1. Requirement Gathering

This is the first step where information is collected from stakeholders, customers, or users.

The goal is to understand what the user expects from the system.

Methods include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and observation.

Example: Asking a client what features they want in an online shopping app.

2. Requirement Elicitation

This step goes deeper into clarifying and refining the requirements gathered.

It involves discussions, workshops, and brainstorming to uncover hidden needs.

Example: During a workshop, discovering that users want an easy checkout process, not just product listings.

3. Requirement Documentation

Here, all the gathered and refined requirements are written down clearly.

Documentation includes Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents.

This ensures everyone (developers, testers, stakeholders) is on the same page.

Example: Writing in the SRS: “The system shall allow users to reset their password via email.”

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

In this step, the requirements are analyzed for completeness, feasibility, and consistency.

Models like flowcharts, use case diagrams, and data models are created to visualize the system.

Example: Creating a use case diagram showing how a user interacts with the shopping cart.

5. Requirement Validation

Finally, the requirements are checked to ensure they are correct and meet user expectations.

Stakeholders review the documented requirements for approval.

Example: The client reviews the SRS and confirms that all necessary features are included.



**3.Ensures Quality and Customer Satisfaction**
By understanding user needs early, the development team can deliver software that meets or exceeds expectations.
